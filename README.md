This project is created to replicate the issue that happens when a virtual-scroll is located inside a div


# This example is based on http://blog.enriqueoriol.com/2017/06/ionic-3-virtual-scroll.html](http://blog.enriqueoriol.com/2017/06/ionic-3-virtual-scroll.html

The example works well, but the problem is when the virtual-scroll is inside a div.


## Install

Execute in terminal `npm install`
If you don't have ionic CLI installed, run also `npm install -g ionic`


## Run

Execute in terminal `ionic serve`
